discussion -----------------------------------------

- global magnetization ?
    - src.mag=(xxx, localMag=True)
    - src = Box(mag,pos,dim,...localMAg=True)

- are typehints really helpful for user ?

- src.pos[15] = (1,2,3)
    diretly setting parts of path


2do-------------------------------------------------
- integrate with existing wheel and distribute
- docu and docstring like scipy
- H testing against FEM
- __init__ docstrings providing brief overviews
- profile getBH
    - numpy reshape and other operations creating copies
- check_dupicates might destroy col.sources order
- add remaining sources
	sphere
	currents
	dipole moment
	facet
- bring edgesize in context with magnetsize

- errors
    - throw errors instead of warning+sys.exit()
    - return error codes
    - write tests for errors

.magnet
- Box()
- Cylinder()
- Sphere()

.current
- Line()
- Circular()

.moment
- Dipole
- FEM
- Virtual


mid term improvements ------------------------------

- add new sources
    - virtual field
    - cone
    - arc
    - tile

- complete type hints
- adress field_BH_Box edge/corner stability problem

- bringing getBv functionality to getB
	getB(*sources, **kwargs
	# M sources
    kwargs= {
		pos_obs = []   		# N1 x N2 x ... x 3
		src_pos = []   		# M x O1 x O2 x ... x 3
		src_rot = []		# M x O1 x O2 x ... x 3
		dim = []			# M x P x dim
		mag = []			# M x P x mag
		niter = 50
		}

- finally adding sensors and sensor paths to getBv

- potential performance increase:
    Can we speed up the computation by combining similar
    pos/dim combinations but different mag, avoiding
    full computation but just perform scalar mult.

    For cuboids this is the same idea as construction
    of the demag tensor.

    its even possible to throw in the scaling property


- Speedup elliptic integrals by complementing cel with
    special cases K and E faster algorithms

- getF
- FEM source
- finite sized currents
- optional input type checking

Cuboid field performance:
    Distinguish if 1-2 or 3 non-zero magnetizations
    and compute as different instances. This should give
    a speedup of a factor 2 or 3 in most cases !

    maybe not worth it - too many cases, too many masks
    speedup only when n>100 and only when just one mag
    in all other cases there is a loss of speed

    probably requires going deeper and modify equations


DONE - NEW FEATURES ------------------------------------
- config
- mag=0 returns 0 now
- edgecases to avoid singularities



DO NOT DO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


class BaseSource
	- getB
	- getH

WHY? : This would improve the copy-paste docstring problem, 
	but not allow direct hints what inputs are needed
	in the src.getB() code inspection. For each source
	they can be quite different.


class BaseGeo
	- __add__

WHY? : We dont want __add__ because a sensor inherits BaseGeo
    but it should not be addable to Collections

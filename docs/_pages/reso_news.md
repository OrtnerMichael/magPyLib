## New Documentation
**18.08.2023**

- Happy to announce our new, more attractive, more user-fiendly and more complete documentation ! Give us Feedback what you think :). There are still a lot of things to do (specifically in the Example section). Documentation updates coming regularly now.

- It is set up for Magpylib version 4.4 - so some documented features might not be working in 4.3 - release is imminent ! If you cannot wait install from  [main branch](https://github.com/magpylib/magpylib).

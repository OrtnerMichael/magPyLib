## Types

Magpylib requires no special input format. All scalar types (`int`, `float`, ...) and vector types (`list`, `tuple`, `np.ndarray`, ... ) are accepted. Magpylib returns everything as `np.ndarray`.

## Units

Length inputs can have arbitrary dimension due to the scaling property - _"a magnet with 1 mm sides creates the same field at 1 mm distance as a magnet with 1 m sides at 1 m distance"_.

Magnetic field outputs are directly proportional to `magnetization`, `current`, and dipole `moment` inputs. For example, when the `magnetization` input unit is T (or mT), then the `getB` output unit is also T (or mT). The following table shows how input and putput units are connected.

# The Magpylib Classes

In Magpylib's object oriented interface magnetic field **sources** (generate the field) and **observers** (read the field) are created as Python objects with various defining attributes and methods.

## Base properties

The following basic properties are shared by all Magpylib classes:

* The <span style="color: orange">**position**</span> and <span style="color: orange">**orientation**</span> attributes describe the object placement in the global coordinate system. By default `position=(0,0,0)` and `orientation=None` (=unit rotation).

* The <span style="color: orange">**move()**</span> and <span style="color: orange">**rotate()**</span> methods enable relative object positioning.

* The <span style="color: orange">**reset_path()**</span> method sets position and orientation to default values.

* The <span style="color: orange">**barycenter**</span> property returns the object barycenter (often the same as position).

See {ref}`docu-position` for more information on these features.


* The <span style="color: orange">**style**</span> attribute includes all settings for graphical object representation. 

* The <span style="color: orange">**show()**</span> method gives quick access to the graphical represenation.

See {ref}`docu-graphics` for more information on graphic output, default styles and customization possibilities.

* The <span style="color: orange">**getB()**</span> and <span style="color: orange">**getH()**</span> methods give quick access to field computation.

See {ref}`docu-field-computation` for more information.


* The <span style="color: orange">**parent**</span> attribute references a [Collection](docu-collection) that the object is part of.

* The <span style="color: orange">**copy()**</span> method can be used to create a clone of any object where selected properties, given by kwargs, are modified.

* The <span style="color: orange">**describe()**</span> method provides a brief description of the object and returns the unique object id.

## Local and global coordinates

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
Magpylib objects span a local reference frame, and all object properties are defined within this frame, for example the vertices of a `Tetrahedron` magnet (see below). The position and orientation attributes describe how the local frame lies within the global coordinates. The two frames coincide by default, when `position=(0,0,0)` and `orientation=None` (=unit rotation).

## Magnet classes

All magnets are sources. They have the <span style="color: orange">**magnetization**</span> attribute which is of the format $(m_x, m_y, m_z)$ and denotes a homogeneous magnetization/polarization vector in the local object coordinates. Information how this is related to material properties from data sheets is found in the [Physics and Computation](phys-remanence) section.

### TriangularMesh
```python
magpy.magnet.TriangularMesh(magnetization, vertices, faces, position, orientation, check_open, check_disconnected, check_selfintersecting, reorient_faces, style)
```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
`TriangularMesh` represents a magnet with surface given by a triangular mesh. The mesh is defined by the <span style="color: orange">**vertices**</span> attribute, an array of all unique corner points $(P_1, P_2, ...)$, and the <span style="color: orange">**faces**</span> attribute, which is an array of index-triplets that define individual faces $(F_1, F_2, ...)$. The property <span style="color: orange">**mesh**</span> returns an array of all faces as point-triples $[(P_1^1, P_2^1, P_3^1), (P_1^2, P_2^2, P_3^2), ...]$.

At initialization the mesh integrity is automatically checked, and all faces are reoriented to point outwards. These actions are controlled via the kwargs
* <span style="color: orange">**check_open**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**check_disconnected**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**check_selfintersecting**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**reorient_faces**</span>

which are all by default set to `"warn"`. Options are `"skip"` (don't perform check), `"ignore"` (ignore if check fails), `"warn"` (warn if check fails), `"raise"` (raise error if check fails).

Results of the checks are stored in the following object attributes
* <span style="color: orange">**status_open**</span> can be `True`, `False` or `None` (unchecked)
* <span style="color: orange">**status_open_data**</span> contatins an array of open edges
* <span style="color: orange">**status_disconnected**</span> can be `True`, `False` or `None` (unchecked)
* <span style="color: orange">**status_disconnected_data**</span> contains an array of mesh parts
* <span style="color: orange">**status_selfintersecting**</span> can be `True`, `None` or `None` (unchecked)
* <span style="color: orange">**status_selfintersecting_data**</span> contains an array of self-intersecting faces
* <span style="color: orange">**status_reoriented**</span> can be `True` or `False`

The checks can also be performed after initialization using the methods
* <span style="color: orange">**check_open()**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**check_disconnected()**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**check_selfintersecting()**</span>
* <span style="color: orange">**reorient_faces()**</span>

The following class methods enable easy mesh loading and creating. They all take the mandatory <span style="color: orange">**magnetization**</span> argument, which overwrites possible magnetization from other inputs, as well as the optional mesh check parameters (see above).

* <span style="color: orange">**TriangularMesh.from_mesh()**</span> requires the input <span style="color: orange">**mesh**</span>, which is an array in the mesh format $[(P_1^1, P_2^1, P_3^1), (P_1^2, P_2^2, P_3^2), ...]$.
* <span style="color: orange">**TriangularMesh.from_ConvexHull()**</span> requires the input <span style="color: orange">**points**</span>, which is an array of positions $(P_1, P_2, P_3, ...)$ from which the convex Hull is computed via the [Scipy ConvexHull](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html) implementation.
* <span style="color: orange">**TriangularMesh.from_triangles()**</span> requires the input <span style="color: orange">**triangles**</span>, which is a list or a `Collection` of `Triangle` objects.
* <span style="color: orange">**TriangularMesh.from_pyvista()**</span> requires the input <span style="color: orange">**polydata**</span>, which is a [Pyvista PolyData](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.PolyData.html) object.

The method <span style="color: orange">**to_TriangleCollection()**</span> transforms a `TriangularMesh` object into a `Collection` of `Triangle` objects.

### Triangle
```python
magpy.misc.Triangle(magnetization, vertices, position, orientation, style)
```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
`Triangle` represents a triangular surface with a homogeneous charge density given by the projection of the magnetization vector onto the surface normal. The <span style="color: orange">**magnetization**</span> attribute stores the magnetization vector $(m_x,m_y,m_z)$. The <span style="color: orange">**vertices**</span> attribute is a set of the three triangle corners $(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ in the local coordinates.
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 3
![](../../_static/images/docu_classes_init_triangle.png)
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 12
**Info:** When multiple Triangles with similar magnetization vectors form a closed surface, and all their orientations (right-hand-rule) point outwards, their total H-field is equivalent to the field of a homogeneous magnet of the same shape. The B-field is only correct on the outside of the body. On the inside the magnetization must be added to the field. This is demonstrated in the tutorial {ref}`gallery-ext-complex-shapes-triangle`.

### CustomSource
```python
magpy.misc.CustomSource(field_func, position, orientation, style)
```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
`CustomSource` is used to create user defined sources with their own field functions. The argument <span style="color: orange">**field_func**</span> takes a function that is then automatically called for the field computation. This custom field function is treated like a [core function](docu-field-comp-core). It must have the positional arguments `field` with values `"B"` or `"H"`, and `observers` (must accept array_like, shape (n,3)) and return the B-field and the H-field with a similar shape.

```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
`Sensor` represents a 3D magnetic field sensor and can be used as Magpylib `observers` input. The <span style="color: orange">**pixel**</span> attribute is an array of positions $(P_1, P_2, ...)$ in the local sensor coordinates where the field is computed. By default `pixel=(0,0,0)` and the sensor simply returns the field at it's position.
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 3
![](../../_static/images/docu_classes_init_sensor.png)
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 12
**Info:** With sensors it is possible to give observers their own position and orientation. The field is always computed in the reference frame of the sensor, which might itself be moving in the global coordinate system. A tutorial {ref}`gallery-tutorial-sensors` is provided in the gallery.

(docu-collection)=

## Collection
```python
magpy.Collection(*children, position, orientation, style)
```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9
A `Collection` is a group of Magpylib objects that is used for common manipulation. All these objects are stored by reference in the <span style="color: orange">**children**</span> attribute. There are several options for accessing only specific children via the following properties

* <span style="color: orange">**sources**</span>: return only sources
* <span style="color: orange">**observers**</span>: return only observers
* <span style="color: orange">**collections**</span>: return only collections
* <span style="color: orange">**sources_all**</span>: return all sources, including the ones from sub-collections
* <span style="color: orange">**observers_all**</span>: return all observers, including the ones from sub-collections
* <span style="color: orange">**collections_all**</span>: return all collections, including the ones from sub-collections

Additional methods for adding and removing children:

- <span style="color: orange">**add()**</span>: Add an object to the collection
- <span style="color: orange">**remove()**</span>: Remove an object from the collection
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 3
![](../../_static/images/docu_classes_init_collection.png)
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 12
**Info:** A collection object has its own `position` and `orientation` attributes and spans a local reference frame for all its children. An operation applied to a collection moves the frame, and is individually applied to all children such that their relative position in the local reference frame is maintained. This means that the collection functions  as a container for manipulation, but child position and orientation are always updated in the global coordinate system. After being added to a collection, it is still possible to manipulate the individual children, which will also move them to a new relative position in the collection frame.

Collections have **format** as an additional argument for **describe()** method. Default value is `format="type+id+label"`. Any combination of `"type"`, `"id"`, and `"label"` is allowed.

A tutorial {ref}`gallery-tutorial-collection` is provided in the example gallery.

# Position, Orientation, and Paths


::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item}
:columns: 7
The explicit magnetic field expressions, implemented in Magpylib, are generally described in convenient coordinates of the sources. It is a common problem to transform the field into an application relevant lab coordinate system. While not technically difficult, such transformations are prone to error.

Here Magpylib helps out. All Magpylib objects lie in a global Cartesian coordinate system. Object position and orientation are defined by the attributes `position` and `orientation`, ð. Objects can easily be moved around using the `move()` and `rotate()` methods. Eventually, the field is computed in the reference frame of the observers.
:::
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 5
![](../../_static/images/docu_position_sketch.png)
:::
::::

Position and orientation of all Magpylib objects are defind by the two attributes

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}
:shadow: none
:columns: 5
<span style="color: orange">**position**</span> - a point $(x,y,z)$ in the global coordinates, or a set of such points $(P_1, P_2, ...)$. By default objects are created with `position=(0,0,0)`.
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:shadow: none
:columns: 7
<span style="color: orange">**orientation**</span> - a [Scipy Rotation object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) which describes the object rotation relative to its default orientation (defined in {ref}`docu-classes`). By default, objects are created with unit rotation `orientation=None`.
:::
::::

The position and orientation attributes can be either **scalar**, i.e. a single position or a single rotation, or **vector**, when they are arrays of such scalars. The two attributes together define the **path** of an object - Magpylib makes sure that they are always of the same length. When the field is computed, it is automatically computed for the whole path.

```{tip}
To enable vectorized field computation, paths should always be used when modeling multiple object positions. Avoid using Python loops at all costs for that purpose! If your path is difficult to realize, consider using the [direct interface](docu-direct-interface) instead.
```

Magpylib offers two powerful methods for object manipulation:

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 5
:shadow: none
<span style="color: orange">**move(**</span>`displacement`, `start="auto"`<span style="color: orange">**)**</span> -  move object by `displacment` input. `displacement` is a position vector (scalar input) or a set of position vectors (vector input).
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 7
:shadow: none
<span style="color: orange">**rotate(**</span>`rotation`, `anchor=None`, `start="auto"`<span style="color: orange">**)**</span> - rotates the object by the `rotation` input about an anchor point defined by the `anchor` input. `rotation` is a [Scipy Rotation object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html), and `anchor` is a position vector. Both can be scalar or vector inputs. With `anchor=None` the object is rotated about its `position`.
:::
::::

- Scalar input is applied to the whole object path, starting with path index `start`. With the default `start="auto"` the index is set to `start=0` and the functionality is **moving objects around**.
- Vector input of length $n$ applies the $n$ individual operations to $n$ object path entries, starting with path index `start`. Padding applies when the input exceeds the existing path. With the default `start="auto"` the index is set to `start=len(object path)` and the functionality is **appending paths**.

The practical application of this formalism is best demonstrated by the following program

```python
import magpylib as magpy

sensor = magpy.Sensor()
print(sensor.position)                                    # default value
#   --> [0. 0. 0.]

sensor.move((1,1,1))                                      # scalar input is by default applied
print(sensor.position)                                    # to the whole path
#   --> [1. 1. 1.]

sensor.move([(1,1,1), (2,2,2)])                           # vector input is by default appended
print(sensor.position)                                    # to the existing path
#   --> [[1. 1. 1.]  [2. 2. 2.]  [3. 3. 3.]]

sensor.move((1,1,1), start=1)                             # scalar input and start=1 is applied
print(sensor.position)                                    # to whole path starting at index 1
#   --> [[1. 1. 1.]  [3. 3. 3.]  [4. 4. 4.]]

sensor.move([(0,0,10), (0,0,20)], start=1)                # vector input and start=1 merges
print(sensor.position)                                    # the input with the existing path
#   --> [[ 1.  1.  1.]  [ 3.  3. 13.]  [ 4.  4. 24.]]     # starting at index 1.
```

When objects with different path lengths are combined, e.g. when computing the field, the shorter paths are treated as static beyond their end to make the computation sensible. Internally, Magpylib follows a philosophy of edge-padding and end-slicing when adjusting paths.

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 7
:shadow: none
**Edge-padding:** whenever path entries beyond the existing path length are needed the edge-entries of the existing path are returned. This means that the object is considered to be âstaticâ beyond its existing path.

**End-slicing:** whenever a path is automatically reduced in length, Magpylib will slice such that the ending of the path is kept.

which compute the magnetic field generated by `sources` as seen by the `observers` in their local coordinates. `sources` can be any Magpylib source object (e.g. Magnets) or a flat list thereof. `observers` can be an array of position vectors with shape `(n1,n2,n3,...,3)`, any Magpylib observer object (e.g. Sensors), or a flat list thereof.

print(B)
#  --> [0.     0.     1.2566]
```
:::
::::

The output of a field computation `magpy.getB(sources, observers)` is by default a Numpy array of shape `(l, m, k, n1, n2, n3, ..., 3)` where `l` is the number of input sources, `m` the (maximal) object path length, `k` the number of observers, `n1,n2,n3,...` the sensor pixel shape or the shape of the observer position array input and `3` the three magnetic field components $(B_x, B_y, B_z)$.

With `squeeze=True` all axes of length 1 in the output (e.g. only a single source) are eliminated.

With `pixel_agg` one can select a compatible numpy aggregator function (e.g. `"min"`, `"mean"`) that is applied to the output. For example, with `pixel_agg="mean"` the mean field of all observer points is returned. Only with this option it is possible to supply `getB` and `getH` with multiple observers that have different pixel shapes.

With `output` it is possible to choose the output format. Options are `"ndarray"` (returns a numpy array) and `"dataframe"` (returns a 2D-table pandas DataFrame).

```{note}
Magpylib collects all inputs (object parameters), and vectorizes them for the computation which reduces the computation time dramatically for large inputs. 

Try to make all field computations with as few calls to `getB` and `getH` as possible. Avoid Python loops at all costs!
```

The tutorial {ref}`gallery-tutorial-field-computation` shows good practices with Magpylib field computation.


(docu-direct-interface)=
## Direct interface

Users can bypass the object oriented functionality of Magpylib and instead compute the field for n given parameter sets. This is achieved by providing the following inputs to the top level functions `getB` and `getH`,

1. `sources`: a string denoting the source type
2. `observers`: array_like of shape (3,) or (n,3) giving the observer positions
3. `kwargs`: a dictionary with inputs of shape (x,) or (n,x)

The allowed values for `sources` are similar to the Magpylib source class names, e.g. `"Cuboid"`, see {ref}`docu-classes`. The `kwargs` must include all mandatory class-specific inputs. All "scalar" inputs of shape (x,) are automatically tiled up to shape (n,x) to create a set of n computation instances. The field is returned in the shape (n,3).

The direct interface is potentially faster than the object oriented one if users know how to generate the input array efficiently with numpy (e.g. `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, `np.tile`, `np.repeat`, ...).

## Core interface

At the heart of Magpylib lies a set of core functions that are our implementations of the explicit field expressions, see {ref}`docu-physics`, described in convenient local source coordinates. Direct access to these functions is given through the `magpylib.core` subpackage which includes,

## Superposition

<!--

## Complex shapes - Superposition

The [**superposition principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle) states that the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses caused by each stimulus individually. This principle holds in Magneto statics when there is no material response, and simply means that the total field created by multiple magnets and currents is the sum of the individual fields.

It is critical to understand that the superposition principle holds for the magnetization itself. When two magnets overlap geometrically, the magnetization in the overlap region is given by the vector sum of the two individual magnetizations.

(examples-union-operation)=

### Union operation

Based on the superposition principle we can build complex forms by aligning simple base shapes (no overlap), similar to a geometric union. This is demonstrated in the following example, where a hollow cylinder magnet is constructed from cuboids. The field is then compare to the exact solution implemented through `CylinderSegment`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib.magnet import Cuboid, CylinderSegment

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(14,5))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(131, projection='3d', elev=24)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(132, projection='3d', elev=24)
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(133)

sensor = magpy.Sensor(position=np.linspace((-4,0,3), (4,0,3), 50))

# ring with cuboid shapes
ts = np.linspace(-3, 3, 31)
grid = [(x,y,0) for x in ts for y in ts]

coll = magpy.Collection()
for pos in grid:
    r = np.sqrt(pos[0]**2 + pos[1]**2)
    if 2<r<3:
        coll.add(Cuboid(magnetization=(0,0,100), dimension=(.2,.2,1), position=pos))
magpy.show(coll, sensor, canvas=ax1, style_magnetization_show=False)

# ring with CylinderSegment
ring = CylinderSegment(magnetization=(0,0,100), dimension=(2,3,1,0,360))
magpy.show(ring, sensor, canvas=ax2, style_magnetization_show=False)

# compare field at sensor
ax3.plot(sensor.getB(coll).T[2], label='Bz from Cuboids')
ax3.plot(sensor.getB(ring).T[2], ls='--', label='Bz from CylinderSegment')
ax3.grid(color='.9')
ax3.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Construction of complex forms from base shapes is a powerful tool, however, there is always a geometry approximation error, visible in the above figure. The error can be reduced by increasing the discretization finesse, but this also requires additional computation effort.

### Cut-out operation

When two objects with opposing magnetization vectors of similar amplitude overlap, they will just cancel in the overlap region. This enables geometric cut-out operations. In the following example we construct an exact hollow cylinder solution from two concentric cylinder shapes with opposite magnetizations, and compare the result to the `CylinderSegment` class solution.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from magpylib.magnet import Cylinder, CylinderSegment

# ring from CylinderSegment
ring0 = CylinderSegment(magnetization=(0,0,100), dimension=(2,3,1,0,360))

# ring with cut-out
inner = Cylinder(magnetization=(0,0,-100), dimension=(4,1))
outer = Cylinder(magnetization=(0,0, 100), dimension=(6,1))
ring1 = inner + outer

print('getB from Cylindersegment', ring0.getB((1,2,3)))
print('getB from Cylinder cut-out', ring1.getB((1,2,3)))
```

Note that, it is faster to compute the `Cylinder` field two times than computing the complex `CylinderSegment` field one time. This is why Magpylib automatically falls back to the `Cylinder` solution whenever `CylinderSegment` is called with 360 deg section angles. Unfortunately, cut-out operations cannot be displayed graphically at the moment, but {ref}`examples-own-3d-models` offer a solution here.

Finally, it is explained in {ref}`examples-triangle`, how complex shapes are achieved based on triangular meshes. -->

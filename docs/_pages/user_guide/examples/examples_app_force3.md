# Magnetic force and torque
Imagine visualizing the invisible forces at play in the magnetic interactions between objects‚Äîthis is what we achieve using Magpylib. 

### But what is force and torque exactly on the topic of magnetization? 
#### FORCE
In the context of magnetic interactions, the force is a vector quantity that represents the push or pull experienced by a magnetic object due to the presence of another magnetic object. This force can cause the object to move if it is free to do so. The force vector has both a magnitude (how strong the force is) and a direction (the direction in which the force acts).

#### Calculation 

The force ùêπ on a magnetic dipole ùëö in a magnetic field ùêµ is given by:

$$ùêπ = ‚àá(ùëö*ùêµ)$$

where 
ùëö is the magnetic moment of the target object. This force is calculated by taking the gradient of the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.


<br>

#### TORQUE

Torque, also known as the moment of force, is a measure of the rotational effect produced by the force on a magnetic object. It is a vector quantity that depends on both the magnitude of the force and the distance from the point where the force is applied to the axis of rotation. Torque causes an object to rotate or change its rotational motion. In magnetic interactions, torque is significant when the magnetic moments of the objects interact, causing them to experience rotational forces.

#### Calculation

The torque ùëá on a magnetic dipole ùëö in a magnetic field ùêµ is given by:

 $$ùëá = ùëö * ùêµ$$

where 
ùëö is the magnetic moment of the target object. This torque is calculated by taking the cross product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

## For the beginning - Step for Step
We will begin with a straightforward example to illustrate how force and torque calculations work.

### Imports 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Imports are necessairy to run the programm with the functions we want to use. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import pyvista as pv
from PIL import Image
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib_force import getFT
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R

```
### Display
```{code-cell} ipython3
def display(targets,sources):

    n_targets = len(targets)
    p = magpy.show(targets + sources, backend='pyvista', return_fig=True,style_legend_show=False)
    FTs = getFT(sources,targets, anchor=None)

    print ("FTs:", FTs) 
    

    force_torque_mag = np.linalg.norm(FTs, axis=-1)

    for i  in range(n_targets):
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[0,:], mag=1/1500, color='g')
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[1,:], mag=1/1500, color='r')
        

    p.camera.position = (8., -40., 15.)
    p.camera.focal_point = (8,0.,8.)
    return p
```
This function displays the output and calculates force and torque. The getFT function is included in the magpylib-force package and is executed in the background. The add_arrows command is important for visualizing the invisible force and torque. The lines of code concerning the camera settings are used to set the camera position and the focal point of the camera.

### Functional Code
```{code-cell} ipython3
if __name__ == "__main__":
# TARGETS: Magpylib target objects that move according to field

    cube = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(position=(8.,0.,8), dimension=(1.,1.,1.), polarization=(1.,0.,0), orientation=R.from_euler('x', 45, degrees=True))
    cube.meshing = (20,20,20)
       
    cylinder = magpy.magnet.Cylinder(position = np.array([3.5,0.,6.]), orientation=R.from_euler('y', 70, degrees=True), dimension=(3.5,3.5), polarization=(0.,0.,0.2))
    
    circle = magpy.current.Circle(position = np.array([13.,0.,6.5]), orientation=R.from_euler('y', -55, degrees=True), diameter=5, current = -110000 )
    
    targets = [cube]
    sources = [cylinder, circle]
    


    for i in range(1):
        p = display(targets,sources)
        os.makedirs('tmp', exist_ok=True)
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
```
In this if statement the magnetic objects are initialized by their position, dimension or diameter, polarization and the orientation. Be aware of, that not every type of object has the same amount of parameters required, to be sure about the construction click [here](https://magpylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_pages/user_guide/docs/docs_classes.html) to get more information.  

The allocation, which magnet is a target and which a source is important for the calculation of force and torque. Sources let act the force on targets, so only the targets will be calculated.

In the for loop, the number in parentheses specifies the number of iterations (or passes) the loop will execute. In this simple example, the loop runs only once `(range(1))`, but in the context of the animation underneath, there are many more steps required to create a video. The command `os.makedirs('tmp', exist_ok=True)` checks if there is a folder named tmp in the same directory as the Python file. If the folder does not exist, the script creates it automatically. If it already exists, the files will not be overwritten due to the exist_ok=True parameter. The line `p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))` specifies the filename for the screenshots. The `{:04d}` ensures clean naming by padding the number with leading zeros, resulting in filenames like 0000.png, 0001.png, and so on, up to a maximum of 9999.png. This naming convention helps maintain an orderly sequence of image files for creating animations.



## Advanced

In this example, we simulate and bring to life the dynamic magnetic interactions between a stationary cube magnet and two moving sources: a cylindrical magnet and a current-carrying loop. As the sources traverse their predefined paths, we calculate and display the magnetic forces and torques acting on the cube magnet, culminating in an animated GIF that vividly captures these interactions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import pyvista as pv
from PIL import Image
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib_force import getFT
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R


os.makedirs('tmp', exist_ok=True)

def display(targets,sources):

    n_targets = len(targets)
    p = magpy.show(targets + sources, backend='pyvista', return_fig=True,style_legend_show=False)
    FTs = getFT(sources,targets, anchor=None)

    print ("FTs:", FTs) 
    

    force_torque_mag = np.linalg.norm(FTs, axis=-1)

    for i  in range(n_targets):
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[0,:], mag=1/1500, color='g')
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[1,:], mag=1/1500, color='r')
        

    p.camera.position = (0., -40., 0.)
    p.camera.focal_point = (8,0.,8.)
    return p


if __name__ == "__main__":
# TARGETS: Magpylib target objects that move according to field

    cube = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(position=(8.,1.,8), dimension=(1.,1.,1.), polarization=(1.,0.,0), orientation=R.from_euler('x', 45, degrees=True))
    cube.meshing = (20,20,20)
       
    cylinder = magpy.magnet.Cylinder(position = np.array([2.,0.,6.]), orientation=R.from_euler('y', 70, degrees=True), dimension=(3.5,3.5), polarization=(0.,0.,0.2))
    
    circle = magpy.current.Circle(position = np.array([13.,0.,6.5]), orientation=R.from_euler('y', -55, degrees=True), diameter=5, current = -110000 )
    
    targets = [cube]
    sources = [cylinder, circle]
    


    for i in range(25):
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
        p.close()

            
    for i in range (25,65) :
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()

    for i in range(65,80):
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
        p.close()

## Code Explenation

This code is a developed version of the simple example above. The changes or additions are listed below.

```python
for i in range(25):
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
        p.close()

            
    for i in range (25,65) :
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()

    for i in range(65,80):
        p = display(targets,sources)
        cylinder.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        circle.move([-0.12,0.,0.])
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
        p.close() 

```
The for loops have been extended. There are now three for loops, and in each for loop, the position of the cylinder and the circle is updated according to the values in brackets. The numbers in brackets represent the naming of the pictures, which will be saved. Overlapping numbers are not allowed, as this would result in the files being overwritten.


```pthon
def make_gif(filename, duration=25, loop=0):
    frames = [Image.open(image) for image in glob.glob(f"tmp/*.png")]
    frames[0].save(
        f"{filename}.gif",
        format="GIF",
        append_images=frames[1:],
        save_all=True,
        duration=duration,
        loop=loop,
        disposal=2, # remove previous image that becomes visible through transparency
    )

make_gif("test", duration=50)
``` 
Additionally, the make_gif function has been added. This function creates a GIF from the pictures saved in the 'tmp' folder.

> [!WARNING]
> Incorrect file savings in the folder will result in a non-functional GIF! If you reduce the numbers in the brackets in the for loops, make sure to delete the folder first to prevent errors in GIF creation.

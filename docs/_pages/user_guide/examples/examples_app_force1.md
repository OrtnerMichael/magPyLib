# Magnetic two-body problem 

This example demonstrates a dynamic simulation of two magnetic objects using magpylib. We simulate the motion and rotation of a cuboid magnet and a spherical magnet under the influence of magnetic forces and torques. The simulation updates the positions and orientations of the magnets over time, visualizing their trajectories, rotational dynamics, and the forces acting on them. A first order semi-implicit Euler method leads to the following equations for the position $\mathbf{s}$, the velocity $\mathbf{v} = \dot{\mathbf{s}}$, the rotation angle $\mathbf{\varphi}$ and the angular velocity $\mathbf{\omega}$ in each time step $\Delta t$:

$$\mathbf{v}(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf{v}(t) + \frac{\Delta t}{m} \mathbf{F}(t)$$

$$\mathbf{s}(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf{s}(t) + \Delta t  \mathbf{v} (t + \Delta t)$$

$$\mathbf{\omega} (t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{Ï‰}(t) + \Delta t  J^{-1} \mathbf{T}(t)$$

$$\mathbf{\varphi} (t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{\varphi}(t) + \Delta t \mathbf{\omega} (t + \Delta t) $$

$\mathbf{F}$ denotes the force and $\mathbf{T}$ the torque acting on the magnet with mass $m$ and inertia tensor $J$.

In this simulation, we model the interactions between two distinct types of magnets: a cuboid magnet and a spherical magnet. The goal is to observe how these magnets influence each other through magnetic forces and torques, and how these interactions affect their motion and rotation.

## Import & Movement
```{code-cell} ipython3
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import pyvista as pv
from PIL import Image
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib_force import getFT
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R


def apply_movement(targets, dt):
    """defines magnet system that is capable for moving according to force and torque
    Parameters
    ----------
    targets: magpylib collection
        Target magnets where movement is performed on
    dt: float
        finite time step for movement simulation
    """
    n_targets = len(targets)

    # calculate force and torque
    FTs = np.zeros((n_targets, 2, 3))
    for i in range(n_targets):
        # sources are all magnets instead of target
        FTs[i,:,:] = getFT(targets[:i] + targets[i+1:], [targets[i]], anchor=None)
    


    # simulate movement
    for i in range(n_targets):
        # calculate movement and rotation
        targets[i].velocity = targets[i].velocity + dt/targets[i].mass * FTs[i,0,:]
        targets[i].angular_velocity = targets[i].angular_velocity + dt*targets[i].orientation.apply(np.dot(targets[i].inverse_inertia_tensor, targets[i].orientation.inv().apply(FTs[i,1,:])))
        targets[i].position = targets[i].position + dt * targets[i].velocity
        targets[i].orientation = R.from_rotvec(dt*targets[i].angular_velocity)*targets[i].orientation

```
The `appply_movement` function simulates the movement and rotation of magnets based on calculated forces and torques. It first determines the forces and torques acting on each magnet due to the other magnets. Then, it updates the magnets' linear and rotational movements by adjusting their velocities, positions, angular velocities, and orientations accordingly.


## Functional Code

```{code-cell} ipython3


t1 = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(position=(2.,0.,2.), dimension=(1.,1.,1.), polarization=(0.,0.,0.92283), orientation=R.from_euler('y', 0, degrees=True))
t1.meshing = (20,20,20)
t1.mass = 2.32
t1.inverse_inertia_tensor = 2.5862069 * np.eye(3)
t1.velocity = np.array([99., 0., 0.])
t1.angular_velocity = np.array([0.,0,0.])

t2 = magpy.magnet.Sphere(position=(2.,0.,4.001), diameter=1.241, polarization=(0.,0.,0.92583), orientation=R.from_euler('y', 0, degrees=True))
t2.meshing = 20
t2.mass = 2.32
t2.inverse_inertia_tensor = 2.798778 * np.eye(3)
t2.velocity = np.array([-99., 0., 0.])
t2.angular_velocity = np.array([0.,0.,0.])

targets = magpy.Collection(t1, t2)
dt = 0.0005


for i in range(150):
    apply_movement(targets, dt)
    
```
Now the allocation of the targets take place. For the movement the two magents need next to position, dimension or diameter, polarization and orientatiion also a mass, velocity and a angular velocity. Also the inverse interia tensor is calculated with the scalevalue and 3x3 diagonal matrix. The scalevalue you have to calculate on your own. `dt` represents the finite time step used in the movement simulation. It denotes the duration of a single simulation step and is used to calculate the updates to the positions, velocities and angular velocities of the magnets over time. The smaller the dt, the more precise and detailed the simulation will be, as changes are computed over smaller increments of time. In the for loop, which is executed 150 times, the apply_movement function is called, thereby updating the values (force, torque, velocity, angular velocity and position) 150 times.

## Prints    

```{code-cell} ipython3
    #cuboid values after movement
    print('cuboid')
    print('position after', t1.position)
    print('velocity after' , t1.velocity)
    print('angular velocity after' , t1.angular_velocity )
    print()

    #sphere values after movement
    print('sphere')
    print('position after', t2.position)
    print('velocity after' , t2.velocity)
    print('angular velocity after' , t2.angular_velocity )



```
Last but not least, the values get printed out in the serial monitor on your device.

## Features

- calculation of the force and torques between magnet objects
- update of magnets velocities, angular velocities and positions



## Visualization

Keep in mind, that if you want to visualize it like the animation above, you need some extra code lines to the code from above.

There is an [Example Animations - Custom export Pyvista](https://magpylib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/user_guide/examples/examples_vis_animations.html#custom-export-pyvista), where you can read up the functionality of visualizing code with Pyvista.

But if you only want to let this example run, without any background information, you can copy the underneath code in the same file, which you have created for the values.

```python

os.makedirs('tmp', exist_ok=True)


def display(targets):

    n_targets = len(targets)
    

    p = magpy.show(targets, backend='pyvista', return_fig=True,style_legend_show=False)

    for i in range(n_targets):
        # sources are all magnets instead of target
        FTs = getFT(targets[:i] + targets[i+1:], [targets[i]], anchor=None)


        force_torque_mag = np.linalg.norm(FTs, axis=-1)
        velocities_mag = np.linalg.norm(targets[i].velocity)
        angular_velocity_mag = np.linalg.norm(targets[i].angular_velocity)

        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[0,:], mag=1/force_torque_mag[0], color='g')
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=targets[i].velocity, mag=1/velocities_mag, color='b')
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=FTs[1,:], mag=1/force_torque_mag[1], color='r')
        p.add_arrows(cent=targets[i].position, direction=targets[i].angular_velocity, mag=1/angular_velocity_mag, color='m')

        p.camera.position = (0., -15., 0.)
        p.camera.focal_point = (2.,0.,3.)
    return p



# #creation of the gif
def make_gif(filename, duration=25, loop=0):
    frames = [Image.open(image) for image in glob.glob(f"tmp/*.png")]
    frames[0].save(
        f"{filename}.gif",
        format="GIF",
        append_images=frames[1:],
        save_all=True,
        duration=duration,
        loop=loop,
        disposal=2, # remove previous image that becomes visible through transparency
    )

make_gif("test", duration=50)

```

> Also the for loop, has to be extended: 
```python
    for i in range(255):
        apply_movement(targets, dt)
        p = display(targets)
        p.off_screen = True
        p.screenshot('tmp/{:04d}.png'.format(i))
        p.show()
        
        p.close()

```


For your understanding, the first line makes sure, if the appropriate folder is existing. Otherwise the folder will be created. The other code can be pasted after the code block from above. Only the for loop in the end has to be adjusted with the last for loop from the programm above.
